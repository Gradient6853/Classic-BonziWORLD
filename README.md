# Classic BonziWORLD

Classic BonziWORLD has been shut down due to all of you supporting a irish sicko

All the source code for the server and client is publically available here. If you want to run your own CB, by all means go ahead. Do whatever you'd like with this code. You don't even need to credit me

## Dependencies
You will need Node.JS and npm to run the server

## Setup
You don't even need to manually install the node modules as they are already included here

If you have Node.JS with npm installed properly. You can run the server by double clicking run.bat or running command prompt in the server folder and doing "node index.js"


After this, Classic BonziWORLD will be accessible on port 80 (if you are running something and the port is taken. please go to settings.json and change the port number). (http://localhost:80/)

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if you screw up anything with your computer while setting this up. I have no idea how you would, but someone will find a way. I also will not provide support for installing dependencies. If you have everything installed properly, the above commands will work.

## Making the server public
If you don't want to host the server privately (localhost). You will need to port forward it. Go to your router settings page (192.160.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 or 10.0.0.1 or whatever the router's ip is). Login with your username and password. Once you have successfully logged in, Go to the port forwarding tab. Then type in your local IP and port number. Hit Save and there you go, Your server will be accessible at "http://[PUBLICIP]:[PORT]".

But if you don't want to port forward. Use the crappy render or replit websites, Either one
